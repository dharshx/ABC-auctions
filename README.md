# ABC-auctions

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of the ABC Auctions dataset using regression models. The goal of this analysis is to predict the sale price of various items sold at auction using different variables such as item description, condition, and age.

### Getting Started:

1. The notebook can be opened and run in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.
2. The necessary Python libraries can be installed using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. The ABC Auctions dataset should be downloaded and saved as "ABC_auctions.csv" in the same directory as the notebook.


### Objective:
To analyze HR practices in 75 North American locations of ABC Auctions and identify key HR practices that drive excellence in auction performance.

### Methodology:
Data on HR practices, employee attitudes, behaviors, and auction performance will be collected and analyzed using statistical methods such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and factor analysis.

### Expected Outcome:
Insights into the relationship between HR practices, employee attitudes, behaviors, and auction performance in 75 North American locations will be gained. Key HR practices that drive excellence in auction performance will be identified, and recommendations for improvement will be provided.

### Results:

1. Improved HR practices that promote longer full-time employee tenure and better employee outcomes can help increase profit.
2. High employee involvement and high organizational commitment are significantly associated with lower FTTerm % and less lot damage/cosign.
3. A high percentage of employees receiving a performance evaluation strongly predicts positive employee involvement.
4. Financial information sharing, selection tests, and annual merit raises were inversely related to employee involvement and organizational commitment.

These findings offer insights into the relationship between HR practices, employee attitudes, behaviors, and auction performance, which can help ABC Auctions identify key HR practices that drive excellence in auction performance and develop strategies for improvement.

### Conclusion:
This study aims to help ABC Auctions maintain consistent HR practices across all branches and drive consistency in overall sales performance.
